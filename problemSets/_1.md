# Problem set 1 â€” README

## Context

Consider the [ai_in_finance.json][1] file, containing 4K+ articles dealing with
the topics of  AI & financial services from The Wall Street Journal and The
Financial Times. For a description of the corpus, see [Lanzolla, Gianvito,
Simone Santoni, and Christopher Tucci. "Unlocking value from AI in financial
services: strategic and organizational tradeoffs vs. media narratives." In
Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Value Creation. Edward Elgar Publishing,
2021.][2]

## Problem

Identify the companies mentioned in the articles, and, for each company, the 
number of mentions (that is, a frequency table). Needless to say, spaCy si the 
place to start. Good luck!
