	"review": "A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a
	haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those
	breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's
	adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do
	Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a
	dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of
	science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version
	known as the \"final cut\" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was
	intended by its director). 
	
	It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the
	sci-fi subgenre now known as \"cyberpunk\", and it was also the first
	\"film noir\" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly
	gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as
	superficial and mere \"eye candy\", it is a philosphically deep film that
	ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow,
	brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used
	to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake:
	this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic.
	10 stars out of 10.
