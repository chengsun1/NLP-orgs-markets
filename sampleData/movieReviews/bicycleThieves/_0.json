	"review": "In post-World War II Italy poverty is a dire reality for a
	large portion of the population. Work is scarce and the opportunities
	for employment are few and far between. \"Ladri Di Biciclette\"
	(translated \"The Bicycle Thief\") is quietly one of the finest films ever
	produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto
	Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up
	when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell
	what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to
	uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes
	immediately as the title character shows up the very first day
	Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the
	bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young
	son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try
	and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. \"The Bicycle Thief\"
	was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for
	Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not
	released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes
	deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through
	is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is
	much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human
	condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and
	mental anguish perfectly. \"The Bicycle Thief\" is an excellent production
	that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects
	that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5."
