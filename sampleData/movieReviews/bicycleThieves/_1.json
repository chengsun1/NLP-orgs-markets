	"by": "Quinoa1984",
	"date": "8 April 2003",
	"review": "Vittorio De Sica's ground/heartbreaking motion picture, The
	Bicycle Thief, is based on a very simple ideal for a story- man against
	the elements. In this case the elements are of a society that is often
	cruel and unforgiving, and that a job in post-war Rome is looked on as
	the luckiest of good luck charms.
	
	Such a man as presented by De Sica is Maggiorani (an actor who really is
	the type of actor right off the street), a father of a little boy who
	gets a job putting up movie posters along some walls in Rome. To do this
	he needs a bicycle, or the job will be lost, and he gets one following a
	pawning of linen sheets. Very soon though, the bicycle is stolen, and
	from there a sad downward spiral unravels for the man and his son as
	they scour the streets for the bicycle. 
	
	While the score adds basic dramatic tension, everything else on the
	screen is done to such a pitch of neo-realism it's at times shattering,
	joyful (scene in the pizzeria the most note-worthy), and with a feeling
	of day-to-day resonance to those who may have not even felt at or below
	the poverty level in their lives. Credit due to all parties involved,
	though I don't think the boy Bruno, played by Staiola, gets nearly
	enough considering his role as a minor coming of age (that moment after
	the father and son leave the church nearly brought tears to my eyes).
