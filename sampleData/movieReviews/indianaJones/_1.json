	"review": "This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant
	boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and
	screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and
	Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than
	Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and
	definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that
	likes fun."
