	"review": "This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is
	also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to
	track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the
	Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure
	story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this
	role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few
	times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered
	around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars
	droids. I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's
	than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an
	adventure movie and more."
