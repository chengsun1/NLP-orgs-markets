It is historically correct and involves a young soldier who was sentenced to be shot for sleeping on post, but who was pardoned by Lincoln and afterward was shot as he led the scattered Union soldiers to victory by rallying them around the colors. Perhaps the most interesting features of this film consist of the visions: first the one that appears to the President as he sees the soldiers, then the gray-haired mother and the nameless grave. At the end where the stars and stripes and stars and bars are rolled together and unrolled as the national flag, there is a touch of patriotic sentiment which is difficult to appreciate without seeing it. After all, the whole story of the Civil War is told in that little bit. While it is by no means certain that the producer intended to make that the climax of the picture, it is, and everyone who sees it is constrained to cheer. - The Moving Picture World, November 19, 1910","imdb_user_review_date":"27 September 2015","imdb_n_helpful_vote":1,"imdb_t_vote":1,"url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001101/reviews","spider":"imdb_user_review","date":{"$date":"2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z"},"imdb_user_rating":null}
