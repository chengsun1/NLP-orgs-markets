## Intro

What are the requirements behind 'data' jobs?  How do the requirements change across titles and employers?

With this second hackathon, you're supposed to use topic modeling to render the job requirements
included in a Kaggle dataset comprising 2,000 job posts recently scraped from Glassdoor.

## Deliverables and deadline

By June 23 (5:00 PM) submit the code for your project and a 5-frame slideshow
illustrating: i) the process for your analysis; ii) the main result you achieve, 
i.e., the extent to which job requirements change across titles and/or employers.
