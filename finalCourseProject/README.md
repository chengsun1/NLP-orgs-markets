## Introduction

As unicorns grow, people have started to contemplate the existence of
the gig economy's dark side. Particularly, the public debate has 
concentrated on the labor conditions of gig workers â€• self-employed
individuals whose behavior is, in fact, constrained by the 
algorithms behind the [business models operated by 
prominent companies such as Airbnb, Deliveroo, or Uber]
(https://www.businessmodelzoo.com/).

## Problem 

For the final course project, students are required to examine
a corpus of text containing the messages Uber drivers exchange
in the [UberPeople](https://www.uberpeople.net/) forum. There
are three operational goals to pursue:

1. to appreciate the set of themes Uber drivers talk about
2. to appreciate the affective states represented in talks 
   among Uber drivers (see [Session 5, part IV](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/applied-NLP-smm694/blob/master/week5/ln_5_IV.ipynb))
3. to appreciate how themes and affective states change 
   over time/different stages of development of Uber

By addressing these three points, students can help to 
uncover the problems Uber drivers talk about (e.g., app,
gps, dashboard, phone, ratings) and the affective correlates
of these problems.

## Main steps for the final course project

Here are the steps students may want to go through:

- select a [community within the forum](https://www.uberpeople.net/forums/)
  that you think is adequate to pursue goals 1-3 
- select a timeframe or a collection of periods (e.g., year-month 
  combinations) that you think is adequate o pursue goals 1-3
- collect a sample of messages exchange in the community you
  want to focus on
  - at least 500 hundred messages are required for the analysis
  - both hand-curated and automated data gathering procedures are 
    admitted
- run a topic modeling to pursue goal #1
- run a sentiment analysis to pursue goal #2
- carry out some statistical post-processing on the outcome of 
  the topic modeling and sentiment analysis to pursue goal #3

## Deliverables

By July 16th (4:00 PM), upload a 10-frame slideshow along with your
code onto Moodle. Julia, Python, R, and Rust code is admitted.
